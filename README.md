## Overview

With the rise of machine learning and higher processing power, modern Optical Character Recognition technology, or OCR as its common abbreviation, is able to recognize more subtle patterns in text. OCR is now better able, although not perfectly, to convert images of handwritten text into machine-encoded text. Hand printed text, because of its many variations has been challenging for OCR. In this _________ i will _____ convert images of handwritten names into _____ text using _____ machine learning.

To accomplish this task, I train the a Convolutional Nueral Network (CNN) using the English alphabet characters from the Handwritting_character dataset, and then use OpenCV library for caracter segmentation  predict on on each character of individual samples of names dataset. Each predicted character gets appended into a list to form a name.
